## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

In this challenge, I built a preview card component, aiming to make it as close to the original design as possible.

The goal was to create a responsive interface where users can:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
